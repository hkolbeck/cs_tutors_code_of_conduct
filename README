This document is a draft of a Code of Conduct for the 
Computer Science Tutors of Portland State University. 

Feedback I am looking for:
- typos, spelling/grammar errors
- Should another section be added? Is any section unnecessary?
- Do you agree with things I've designated as part of or not part of the tutors' responsibilities?

Please give me notes or make a pull request.
